# ðŸ¤– Basic_Chatbot

This is a user-friendly Python chatbot that responds to a few basic phrases using simple logic. it works with fixed rules and responses.

## ðŸ§  What This Project Does

The chatbot talks with you based on what you type. It understands a few pre fixed simple phrases like:

- You say: `hello` â†’ Bot says: `Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ How can I help you today?`
- You say: `how are you` â†’ Bot says: `I'm feeling pretty good! ðŸ˜Š What about you?`
- You say: `bye` â†’ Bot says: `Goodbye! Take care! ðŸ‘‹`

If you type something it doesn't recognize, it will reply with:
> `"Hmm... Iâ€™m not sure how to respond to that. Try saying 'help' to see what I can do."`

## ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts Used

- `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
- Functions in Python
- Loops (to keep the chat going)
- Taking user input and displaying responses

## ðŸš€ Features
